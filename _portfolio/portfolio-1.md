After understanding the needs of my peers, I  conducted coevolutionary analysis on a total of 914,000 protein sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 NSP3 and NSP4 proteins. Through this analysis, I was able to assist in shortening the membrane-interacting regions involved in their interaction to just a few base pairs.
