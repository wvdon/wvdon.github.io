excerpt: 'We analyzed and predicted the mutation rates of the whole genome and main proteins of SARS-CoV-2 from different populations to understand the adaptive relationship between humans and COVID-19. Our study identified a correlation of the mutation rates from each protein of SARS-CoV-2 and various human populations. Overall, this analysis provides a scientific basis for developing data-driven strategies to confront human pathogens.'

We analyzed and predicted the mutation rates of the whole genome and main proteins of SARS-CoV-2 from different populations to understand the adaptive relationship between humans and COVID-19. Our study identified a correlation of the mutation rates from each protein of SARS-CoV-2 and various human populations. Overall, this analysis provides a scientific basis for developing data-driven strategies to confront human pathogens.
